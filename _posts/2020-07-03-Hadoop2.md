Downloading Hadoop

Download hadoop on Google (version 2.10.0)
unzip tarfile in ubuntu server
in folder/etc/hadoop, modify several xml configuration files

core-site.xml: 
hdfs-site.xml:
yarn-site.xml
Then use cp mapred-site.xml.template mapred-site.xml to create mapred-site.xml
and set configuration for mapred-site.xml

Also set setting for hadoop-env.sh, which doesn't have java path set up
set java's setting to /home/gnkwon/jdk1.8.0_201
