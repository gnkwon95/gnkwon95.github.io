01. Intro to Big Data

* What determines big data?
Volume, variety, velocity, value, veracity (uncertainty and inconsistency)

structured = in table format
semi-structured = json, xml, csv
unstructured = mp3, mp4, jpeg


01-1. Big Data Analytics and Big Data Applications

Sample use of Data Analytics

NYPD smarter prediction of crime
AWS customer behavior analysis for better satisfaction
cost reduction by hospitals - monitor patients, predict outcome, prepare supplies to save cost
Next generation products (self-driving cars, Netflix, etc)

01-2. Stages in Data Analytics

1. identify problem
2. design data requirement
3. preprocessing
4. analytics
5. visualize

01-3. Types of big data analysis

descriptive analytics - describe/ summarize raw data
    ex) google analytics tool - explain what happened in past

predictive analytics - 
    ex) SouthWest Airlines - identify pattern to predict possible error, so fix with lower input prior to error

prescriptive analytics - provide advice
    ex) Machine learning, train data, make recommendation (self-driving car)

diagnostic analytics - understand why something happened in past
    ex) time series of sales - explain why certain sale happened in that time

02. Introduction to Hadoop
